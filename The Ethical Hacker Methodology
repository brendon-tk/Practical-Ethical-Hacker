Ethical hacking follows a structured process to identify and address security vulnerabilities. The five key stages of ethical hacking are:

1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
This is the pre-attack phase, where the ethical hacker gathers as much information as possible about the target system. It can be active (direct interaction) or passive (indirect methods).

ðŸ”¹ Techniques:
âœ” Google Dorking
âœ” WHOIS lookup
âœ” Social engineering
âœ” Network scanning
âœ” DNS footprinting

2. Scanning & Enumeration
In this phase, the ethical hacker identifies live hosts, open ports, and services running on the target system. The goal is to detect vulnerabilities.

ðŸ”¹ Techniques & Tools:
âœ” Nmap (port scanning)
âœ” Netcat (network connections)
âœ” Nessus (vulnerability scanning)
âœ” SNMP & SMB enumeration

3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)
Here, the hacker exploits vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system. The level of access gained determines the attack impact.

ðŸ”¹ Methods:
âœ” Exploiting weak credentials
âœ” SQL Injection
âœ” Buffer Overflow
âœ” Privilege Escalation

4. Maintaining Access (Persistence)
After gaining access, the hacker attempts to maintain control over the system for future exploitation or further testing.

ðŸ”¹ Persistence Techniques:
âœ” Installing backdoors (e.g., Netcat, Meterpreter)
âœ” Creating hidden user accounts
âœ” Modifying system services
âœ” Rootkits and Trojans

5. Covering Tracks (Clearing Evidence)
To avoid detection, the hacker removes logs and traces of their activities to ensure stealth.

ðŸ”¹ Techniques:
âœ” Deleting logs (Windows Event Viewer, Linux log files)
âœ” Disabling security monitoring tools
âœ” Modifying timestamps (Timestomping)
âœ” Using anti-forensic tools
